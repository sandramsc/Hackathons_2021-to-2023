## 🔴 CRITICAL TASKS (Must Complete - 4 hours)

### 1. Fix & Verify IBM Deployment (1.5 hours) ⚠️

**Current Issue:** Instance scope error (404)  
**Status:** Needs verification/fix

#### Step 1: Verify IBM Cloud Access (15 min)
1. Go to: **https://cloud.ibm.com/watsonx/orchestrate**
2. Login with your IBM Cloud credentials
3. Verify you can access your instance
4. Check instance ID matches: `f16c2181-a811-4d84-8e15-33cfebe50928`

#### Step 2: Deploy via Web UI (30 min) - **RECOMMENDED METHOD**

**Why Web UI:** More reliable than CLI, avoids authentication issues

**Steps:**
1. **Open IBM Portal:**
   ```
   https://cloud.ibm.com/watsonx/orchestrate
   ```
   Or direct link:
   ```
   https://au-syd.watson-orchestrate.cloud.ibm.com/build/manage
   ```

2. **Navigate to Agents:**
   - Click **"All agents"** or **"Skills"** in left sidebar
   - Look for: **"ProActive_CSI_Agent_404"**
   - If found: Click **"Edit"**
   - If not found: Click **"Create agent"** or **"Import agent"**

3. **Upload Configuration:**
   - Click **"Import from file"** or **"Upload"**
   - Navigate to:
     ```
     /Users/ishwaryasridharan/Desktop/Hackathon_2025/Agentic_AI/agent404-proactive-csi/
     ```
   - Select: `proactive-csi-agent-orchestrate.yaml`
   - Click **"Open"** or **"Upload"**
   - Wait for upload (5-10 seconds)

4. **Connect IBM Services:**
   - Go to **"Connections"** or **"Integrations"** tab
   - Verify/Add these services:
     - ✅ **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
     - ✅ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
     - ✅ **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
     - ✅ **Cloudant** (if needed)
     - ✅ **watsonx.ai** (if needed)

5. **Save and Activate:**
   - Click **"Save"** button
   - Click **"Activate"** or **"Publish"**
   - Wait for activation (10-30 seconds)
   - Status should show: ✅ **Active** or ✅ **Deployed**

#### Step 3: Test Deployment (15 min)
1. **Open Chat Interface:**
   - Click on your agent to open chat
   - Agent name: **"ProActive_CSI_Agent_404"**

2. **Test Queries:**
   ```
   "Good morning, what's my priority today?"
   ```
   ```
   "Tell me about Acme Corporation"
   ```
   ```
   "Show churn trends this quarter"
   ```

3. **Test STT/TTS (if configured):**
   ```
   "Read me the executive briefing aloud using Text-to-Speech"
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent responds correctly
- ✅ All workflows execute
- ✅ Services are connected (green status)
- ✅ Agent is Active/Deployed

#### Step 4: Get Deployment URL (5 min)
1. **Copy Agent URL:**
   - In IBM Portal, find your agent
   - Copy the shareable URL or chat URL
   - Format: `https://au-syd.watson-orchestrate.cloud.ibm.com/...`

2. **Save URL for submission:**
   - This is your **Application URL** for submission
   - Format: `https://[region].watson-orchestrate.cloud.ibm.com/[path]`
